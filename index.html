    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a system of inherited class?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">A system of inherited class is exactly what it sounds like: A system which inherits its class.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What were the groups (classes) in Medival Japan?</h2>
     <img alt="ss" src="cssjs/img/ss.png" style="width: 350px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
    <div><p>The hierarchy can be represented in a pyramid; the ruler on the top, and the rest of them represented different kinds of classes. From the bottom up, there are merchants, artisans, peasants, samurai, daimyos, shogun, and finally, the emperor at the top.</p></div>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is lobbying and how does it compare to a characteristic of Feudal Japan?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Here is the definition of lobbying: "seek to influence (a politician or public official) on an issue.
<p style="text-align: center;">The way this relates to feudalism is that the emperors (or presedent) do not have all the power.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How the cookie crumbles: Our Society Vs. Feudalism</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">In feudal Japan, the emperor is in authority of the court. While the main source of power comes from the shogun, which was a military commander. For the shogun to keep his power, he gave land to warlords. In return, these warlords would give military support to the shogun. The military was made up of samurai. Samurai were strong warriors with their main weapon being a katana.
    Our society is either a monarchy or a democracy.  A monarchy is a single person ruling over land. One country that is a monarchy is Great Britain. Democracy, or representative democracy is where the people choose who they want to lead them. Then that person, as well as others, make laws and run the country. Our society normally has an army with soldiers. They use guns and other weaponry to fight instead of a sword.
    Now let's look at the similarities between them. One similarity is how many people rule. In feudal Japan and in Great Britain, One person is the main ruler. Either it be a king or a shogun. Both have a military with the main power controlling it.
    . All in all, feudal Japan and our society are both similar and different from each other in many different ways.</p>
