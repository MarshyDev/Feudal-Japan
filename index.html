        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a system of inherited class?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">A system of inherited class is exactly what it sounds like: A system which inherits its class.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What were the groups (classes) in Medieval Japan?</h2>
         <img alt="ss" src="cssjs/img/ss.png" style="width: 350px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
        <div><p>The hierarchy can be represented in a pyramid; the ruler on the top, and the rest of them represented different kinds of classes. From the bottom up, there are merchants, artisans, peasants, samurai, daimyos, shogun, and finally, the emperor at the top.</p></div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is lobbying and how does it compare to a characteristic of Feudal Japan?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Here is the definition of lobbying: "seek to influence (a politician or public official) on an issue.
    <p style="text-align: center;">The way this relates to feudalism is that the emperors (or president) do not have all the power.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">How the cookie crumbles: Our Society Vs. Feudalism</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">In feudal Japan, the emperor was the most powerful person in the court. While the main source of power came from the shogun, who served as the army commander. In order to keep the shoguns in power, he gave land to the lords. In return, these lords would provide military support to the shogun. The army was made up of samurai. Samurai are powerful warriors whose main weapon is a katana.
    Our society is a monarchy or a democracy.
    Monarchy is a single person who rules over a territory. A monarchy country is the United Kingdom. Democracy or representative democracy is where people choose who they want to lead. Then that person, along with others, makes the laws and rules of the country.  Let us now consider the similarities between them. Another similarity is the number of rulers. In feudal Japan and England, one person was the main ruler. Be it a king or a general. Both have an army with the main power controlling it. In general, feudal Japanese society and our country's society are both similar and different in many aspects.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">If a bad decision is made in our society, then it may or may not affect all people. In feudal Japan, then the whole society could collapse.</p>  </body>
